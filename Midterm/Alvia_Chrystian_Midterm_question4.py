My favorite was question 3 because it was the most challenging

question 1 took me about 30 minutes to figure out, my brain couldn't figure out the sequence
question 2 took me 5 minutes because I already had it implemented from a homework assignment
question 3 took me the remaining time to figure out how to find the biggest/second biggest number in the sequence
