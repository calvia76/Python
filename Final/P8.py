#This exam was incredibly complex for the amount of time given, only because I crumble under pressure
#and need ample time to figure out the best way to implement something by planning/suedo code


#I spent about 10 minutes on the first problem, easy.
#Problem 2 I would need at least an hour to figure out alone.
#Problem 3 Took me about 30 minutes to get working correctly
#Problem 4 would take me an hour to figure out if I had the time
#Problem 5 would take me an hour to get all the values into a list and then implement, not even attempting it
#Problem 6 took me about 30 minutes
#Problem 7 was straight forward but I ran out of time by the time I attempted each problem.
#also feel like I didn't have enough experience in self-referencing fucntions to attempt it as well.


#Exam would have been easier if the lists of values were already there to
#Copy over to save time instead of making us write out the dictionaries/lists

#Overall enjoyed the class, I found out that I love Python way more than Java
#I would make exams easier and homework problems more difficult since there is
#ample time to work on homework assignments and only 1:20 hr for midterm and
#3 hours for 7 complex problems on the final exam.
